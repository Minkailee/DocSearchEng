This is the Project of F4 group in course COMP9900. The project name is Legal Cases Assistant which is a search engine in legal field
How do I get set up?
In this project, we use python language and flask micro framework to build our searching engine. Therefore, python environment, flask and several packages need to be installed in the computer before the setup. You also need to use a complier to run this project and we recommend PyCharm because it can install packages easily. After setting the environment of the project, you also need to change the former variable “rootdir” to the absolute path of the project in your own computer on app.py file.
Now, click the run button to build the project and the web application will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. (Before that, you also need to make sure interface 5000 is not used on your host.) You can input the website into the address bar of your browser or open the link in the active tool window. Then, you can see the main page of the web application.
